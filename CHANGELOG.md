  - Self-reflection protocols for continuous improvement
  - Knowledge gap identification system
  - Solution quality improvement mechanisms
  - Code analysis with structured output
  - Systematic reasoning protocols
  - Extended thinking with configurable depth (think/think harder/ultrathink)

- **Context Schemas** (`context/schemas/`)
  - Code Understanding Schema for standardized code analysis
  - Troubleshooting Schema for systematic problem resolution
  - JSON Schema validation for structured data

- **Hooks System** (`src/core/hooks.js`)
  - Lifecycle management for all operations
  - Pre-commit, post-code, security-check, and error recovery hooks
  - Extensible hook registration system
  - Automatic hook discovery and loading

### 🔧 Executable Commands

- **init-os Command** (`src/commands/init-os.js`)
  - Complete project initialization
  - Directory structure creation
  - Git hooks setup
  - Session management initialization

- **context-prime Command** (`src/commands/context-prime.js`)
  - Comprehensive project analysis
  - Technology stack detection
  - Architecture mapping
  - Pattern identification
  - Dependency analysis
  - Security assessment
  - Quality metrics

### 🎮 CLI Interface

- **Command Line Interface** (`src/cli.js`)
  - Interactive mode with REPL
  - Protocol execution commands
  - Thinking commands with depth levels
  - Code analysis tools
  - Self-reflection and gap analysis

### 📦 Project Configuration

- **Package.json** - Complete Node.js project setup with:
  - All necessary dependencies
  - Script commands for common operations
  - Jest testing configuration
  - ESLint and Prettier configuration

- **Environment Template** (`.env.template`)
  - Comprehensive configuration options
  - Security settings
  - Feature flags
  - MCP server configuration

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Improvements

- **Memory System** (`context/memory/`)
  - Structured directories for sessions, patterns, knowledge
  - Context preservation between sessions
  - Error logging and recovery

- **Main Entry Point** (`src/index.js`)
  - Unified system initialization
  - Global protocol registry
  - Command handling system
  - Status monitoring

### 🔄 Alignment with Context Engineering

| Component | Implementation Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Protocol Shells | ✅ Fully Implemented | Core framework in place |
| Cognitive Tools | ✅ Implemented | 6 core protocols active |
| Context Schemas | ✅ Implemented | 2 primary schemas defined |
| Memory System | ✅ Basic Implementation | Structured storage ready |
| Hooks System | ✅ Fully Implemented | Lifecycle management active |
| Executable Commands | ✅ Implemented | Core commands functional |

### 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialize Claude Code OS
npm run init

# Prime context
npm run prime

# Or use CLI
npx cclos init
npx cclos prime --deep
npx cclos interactive
```
